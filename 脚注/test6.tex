\footnote{Source text: Wikipedia (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum})}But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose.

No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
