# Hidden Markov model (HMM) transition smoothing

## Notes

This diagram represents all the variables (known or previously computed) related in determining the probability of taking a transition i -> j at time t within a hidden Markov model (HMM); this is one of the initial estimation steps of the Baum-Welch algorithm.
