# Generative adversarial network (GAN)

## Notes

A simple representation of a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, abstracting away from the neural network architectures used in the generator and discriminator. Can be easily extended into an animated illustration of the training schedule for GANs (by "sliding") the arrow into one of the two locked positions.
