# X-LSTM

## Notes

A diagram representing a cross-modal long-short term memory (X-LSTM) architecture, in a hierarchical fashion (starting with a single LSTM cell, representing it as a component of a single unrolled LSTM block, then representing a cross-modal variant as the interchange of LSTM blocks on multimodal sequences). Features careful use of positioning and redrawing.
