# 1D-2D cross-connection

## Notes

An in-depth view of a 1D-2D cross-connection, (such as the one used by the [XFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00572)) publication. Illustrates a reshape-deconvolution operation taking the 1D data to a 2D feature map, and a flatten-dense operation taking the 2D feature map to flat 1D features. The graphic leverages strategically positioned circles to give off the illusion of depth.
