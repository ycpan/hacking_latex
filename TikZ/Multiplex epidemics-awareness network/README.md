# Multiplex epidemics-awareness network

## Notes

Illustration of the network dynamics of an epidemics-awareness model, akin to Granell *et al.* (2014). Nodes take part in both the epidemics layer (SIS + vaccinated) and the awareness layer (UAU). This, in my opinion, represents one of the "cleaner" ways to draw multiplex networks in Ti*k*Z, making heavy use of scopes and transformations.
