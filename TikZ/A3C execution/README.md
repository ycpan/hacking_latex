# A3C execution

## Notes

A diagram representing a potential intermediate state of execution for the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm---right after Agent 1 concludes its ongoing rollout. It features usage of split rectangles to represent a (partially filled) queue data structure, as well as several interesting positioning hacks.
