# Multiplex chain Gaussian mixture hidden Markov model (Multiplex chain GMHMM) (beta)

## Notes

The beta version of the example of a multiplex chain Gaussian mixture hidden Markov model. While it wasn't retained for an official publication, it demonstrates interesting and difficult aspects of tightly integrating Ti*k*Z with `axis`.
