# Fully-connected cross-connection

## Notes

An in-depth view of a fully-connected cross-connection, as used by Bica *et al.* (ESANN 2018). Features a scope transformation to allow independently developing the nodes in both streams, then seamlessly connecting them with the cross-connecting edges when necessary.
