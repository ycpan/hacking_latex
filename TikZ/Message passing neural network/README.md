# Message passing neural network (MPNN)

## Notes

An overview of the *Message passing neural network* architecture by [Gilmer et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212), illustrating the elements involved in computing the next-level features of a given node in a graph, along with the relevant neural network modules.
