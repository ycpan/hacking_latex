# Cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN)

## Notes

A simple representation of a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) architecture, abstracting away from the neural network architectures used in the generators and discriminators. Can be easily extended into an animated illustration of the training schedule for CycleGANs (by "sliding") the arrow into one of the two locked positions.
