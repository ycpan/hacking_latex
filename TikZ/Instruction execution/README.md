# Instruction execution

## Notes

A schematic of a single instruction being fetched, decoded and executed on the GameBoy's CPU. Features prominent use of scopes and custom coordinates. 

**N.B.** Originally designed for a `beamer` presentation; in order to make it properly display on a `standalone` document class, I had to draw a rectangle around roughly the image area.
