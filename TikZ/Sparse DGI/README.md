# Sparse Deep Graph Infomax (DGI)

## Notes

An illustration of the application of Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) to large-scale graph datasets (such as Reddit)---by way of _subsampling_, as is done by approaches such as GraphSAGE. Besides the usual colourful and decorative elements, here I have expressed node shifts using _polar coordinates_, to provide a faithful "radial" expansions of neighbourhoods.
